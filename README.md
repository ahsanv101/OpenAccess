# DATANOMICS 

This project was made as part of the course Open Access and Digital Ethics taught by Monica Palmirani

The goal of this project is to perform analysis on multiple open source datasets, using various concepts an methods taught in class, as well as to visualize them through the production of mashup, linked open data sets.

# ANALYSIS

Our project aims to show connections and disconnections between internet use, education levels and the labor market, focusing on European countries.

# DATASETS

To conduct this research, we collected data from three distinct organizations which provide open access datasets, each with their own goals, licenses and formats.

# Scenario

A flourishing labor market involves a couple of different factors, of which the interaction is complex and the main ingredients hardly distinguishable. While it is commonly assumed that education levels are the main determinant for countries’ employment rates, the use and access to internet technology can be seen as a rising factor for struggling against unemployment. Indeed, in the search for jobs, such information technology has become a crucial tool, to link employers with new employees, through the publication of job offers and the access of this information by the appropriate candidates. Through the datasets we collected and mashed-up together, we aim to provide an heterogeneous perspective on the complexity of contemporary economies and its increasingly technologically-mediated workforce.

# Hypothesis

We began our project by assuming these three hypothesis, as to the relationship that education level, labor market and internet use have with one another:

1. We hypothesized that education level has a strong impact on the labor market.
2. We assumed that use of internet technology has become a determining factor, alongside education levels, for European countries’ employment rates.
3. Finally, we expected the correlation between education levels and internet use to be low - that is, we presumed that these two aspects are rather independent from each other.
